## What I implemented

- RK4 integrator for accurate, stable double-pendulum physics.

- Modular C code (physics, render, trails) with clean headers.

- High-quality visuals: grid background, neon glow, additive blend "bloom", motion trails, soft radial pulse on energy spikes, color-cycling accent.

- Controls:

    SPACE — pause/resume

    R — reset

    X — randomize initial conditions

    Z / C — slow down / speed up

    T — toggle trails

    G — toggle grid

    H — toggle HUD (info text)

    ESC — quit

- Safe resource handling and fallback font detection.
